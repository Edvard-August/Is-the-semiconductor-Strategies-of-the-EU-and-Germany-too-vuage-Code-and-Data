The project deals with the structuring of R&amp;D&amp;I Funding data retrieved from Cordis into edge lists that be used for Sosial Network Analysis. Specifically, these edge lists take the form of spread sheets, and the data is treated as if the edges are directed and weighted (funding mobilized/ total cost). The data is organised with help of Python Program, that is centred on around Pandas, for loops and dictionaries. It should be mentioned a part of the program is probably not needed, this part takes a file containing R&amp;D&amp;I funding data for the same projects, but this time retrieved through a web scraping application (Octoparse 8) and checks if the website version of the data is more extensive in cases of missing data from the Primary data set. It does not appear to be case.
